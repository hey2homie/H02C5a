# H02C5a

In-depth study of a structured and disciplined approach to develop medium-sized, sequential software systems using the paradigm of object oriented programming.  
Class notes are [here](https://btj.github.io/ogp-notes/)

### Part I:

For Part I of the project, you shall complete the implementations of these classes, in accordance with the provided documentation, such that a working (simplified) Pac-Man game is obtained. You shall ensure that these classes are properly encapsulated.

### Part II:

In this [second part](https://btj.github.io/ogp-notes/pacman-part2.html) of the PacMan project, you will extend the system of Part 1 with Power Pellets and Ghost States.

### [Part III](https://btj.github.io/ogp-notes/pacman-part3.html):

Develop, in package `pacman.wormholes`, an abstraction for manipulating graphs whose nodes are departure portals (represented by instances of class `DeparturePortal`), arrival portals (represented by instances of class `ArrivalPortal`), and wormholes (represented by instances of class `Wormhole`). Extend class `Maze` so that it also keeps a list of departure portals, a list of arrival portals, and a list of wormholes.

### Notes regarding the course

Damn this documentation madness!
